## Building

You need a [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org) development stack with [npm](https://npmjs.org) installed to build the project.

To install all project dependencies execute

```
npm install
```

Build the application (including [bpmn-js](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js)) via

```
npm run all
```

You may also spawn a development setup by executing

```
npm run dev
```

Both tasks generate the distribution ready client-side modeler application into the `public` folder.

Serve the application locally or via a web server (nginx, apache, embedded).
